# ggplot: A grammar of graphics implementation for Wolfram Language


## Major functionality still to work or working through:

- Ability to use functions inside aesthetics (i.e. "color" -> `Function[#var < 8]`)
- Also need to be able to use functions inside x and y (i.e. "x" -> `Function[#x * 5]`)
- Scaling (ensure correct functionality and continue to add additional scaling functions)
- Legends
- geoms other than lines and points
- Coordinates
- Labels
